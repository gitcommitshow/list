# The List

This catalog tracks the developer-first things still worth bookmarking when the web feels automated. The focus is on authentic discoveries: tools, software, plugins, MCP projects, blogs, and communities that carry a human pulse.

## What Shows Up Here

- Developer tools that actually smooth painful workflows.
- Software that earns a permanent slot on someone’s dock.
- Plugins that feel like hidden shortcuts rather than bloat.
- MCP builds/protocol experiments that keep interoperability weird.
- Blogs that still publish opinionated essays or lab notes.
- Communities (forums, chats, newsletters, meetups) where replies come from people, not bots.

## Why Curate This

Dead internet theory suggests most feeds are just AI filler. The antidote is a transparent chain of tastemakers who document what still feels alive. Every entry should include who vouched for it, why it matters, and how to explore further. That context keeps the archive honest and shows the handmade web survives whenever someone takes time to care.
